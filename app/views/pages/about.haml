  My name is David Pedersen and I'm a programmer living in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is my site where I write about things that I find interesting. It's mostly geek stuff but could also be about other things.

  This site is made using:

  - Scss for styling.
  - CoffeeScript and JavaScript for client-side functionality.
