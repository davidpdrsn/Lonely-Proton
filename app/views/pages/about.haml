  My name is David Pedersen and I'm a programmer living in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is my site where I write about things that I find interesting. It's mostly geek stuff but could also be about other things.

  You can find me here:

  - [davidpdrsn](http://github.com/davidpdrsn) on GitHub.
  - [david.pdrsn@gmail.com](mailto:david.pdrsn@gmail.com) is my real email.

  This site is made using:

  - HTML for markup.
  - Scss for styling.
  - CoffeeScript and JavaScript for functionality.
  - [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for application code.
  - [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing.
  - [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) for text editing.
  - Git for version control.
  - GitHub and Capistrano for deploying.
  - Apache for serving the application.
  - [Linode](https://www.linode.com) for hosting.
